## This is the website for assignment 3 of Programming For Design

  #### Producer Notes

    The chosen topic was Australia in 2050. For this website I decided to use that topic but modify it a bit
    so that it included events on the lead up to 2050. I thought it would allow me to do things more creatively
    and give a bit of a challenge. The website has a timeline at the bottom with key events in decades leading 
    up to 2050, starting with 2020.

    I had a few more aethetic things I wanted to add to the website like parralax scrolling or a video that played
    as you scrolled but I'm not familiar with Javascript and CSS enough to do that. With more time, I would have 
    another go at the parralax scrolling and add more events to the page as some parts of the page look quite 
    bare
