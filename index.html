          At the time of this page releasing, we have already lived through a third of the 20s. 
          <br>
          It started with 
          one of the worst years for Australia, with the record breaking summer causing Black Summer Bush Fires, and 
          <br>

          Black Summer Bush Fires ended the previous decade and began the new one in an unforgettable way. Starting in June of
          2019 and ending in May 2020, it was the most worst fire season in Australian History, destroying an estimated 243,000
          square kilometers. 
          <br>
          It claimed an estimated 3 billion animals, driving some to extinction. So much smoke was created from 
          the fires that it started effecting the weather of other continents.

          COVID 19 Pandemic. This pandemic was alerted to the WHO in 2019 but wasn't declared a pandemic until
          March of 2020. It was one of the largest and deadliest pandemics since the Spanish Flu in 1918. Australia,
          like the rest of the world, was completely closed down, and it became a very lonely and difficult period for some.
          <br>
          We also had our own screw ups and difficulties with the pandemic, having a 0 covid policy that you could argue, hurt
          the country more than it helped.

          This is when the world is likely to breach an everage temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celcius.
          This increase will have a dramatic effect on the world, especially Australia. With vast deserts and very hot summers, this 
          will worsen under the effects of climate change, with summers worse than that of 2019-2020 expected to come.

          Melbourne should overtake Sydney as Australias most populous city. Sydney has has had this title since taking
          it from Melbourne in 1905. However depending on how you measure Sydney and Melbourne, Melbourne already holds
          this title and has until 2019. This is because of the classification of what is Greater Sydney, including some
          of the South Coast.

          The 2050s seem so far away right now, this makes it extremely difficult to predict what Australia will be like with some degree

          This is the year that the Australian government aims to be net carbon neutral by. This doesn't mean we produce 0 carbon, it just means 
          we produce enough carbon that we can offset it so it doesn't contribute to climate change. This is a massive milestone for Australia
          and could bring about an amazing future for australia we think of when we think about the future. We no longer directly contribute to 
          climate change, we can focus on other problems of the future that will inevitably arise.
